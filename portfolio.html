   <br>
   <h3 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">My first project ever done fully in python was a simple icecream parolor game.
    <br> It uses pyhton turtle, a common class of python, to ask questions of what type of icecream you want!
    <br> You can pick from a variety of flavors, amount of scoops, and toppings!
    <br> The project was co-createad by Mikhal Tapia, who helped signifigantly with the if then procedure.
    <br> An image of a possible ice cream in the game is placed above!</h3>

   <img src="galaga.PNG" height="300">
   <h3 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">My second project completed fully in python is a Galaga remake.
    <br> It uses pyhton turtle, a common class of python, to ask move different entities, allow for shooting, and checking for collisions.
    <br> The game spawns multiple enemies you have a time limit to hit.
    <br> If you hit every enemy in the time limit, a new wave spawns and you can keep going.
    <br> The project was completed with Tristan Bergo, and a picture is shown above.</h3>

  <img src="card.PNG" height="300">
  <h3 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">My third project completed fully in python is an E-Card.
    <br> It uses pyhton turtle, a common class of python, to import images, add random lists, and make confetti.
    <br> The card asks if you want a Trick or a Treat
    <br> Depending on what you select, it will make a scary or fun image!
    <br> The project was completed with a group of 4, and a picture is shown above.</h3>

  <h3 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">My 4th project completed fully in python is an a security system for a fish tank monitor.
    <br> It uses pyhton to create a security system.
    <br> We also used it to find security vulnerabilities.
    <br> The project was very fun, but challenging
    <br> The project was completed with a group of 4, Kamryn, Maddy, Lauren, and myself. A picture is shown above.</h3>

    <br> I created it with a group of 4, Kamryn, Maddy, Lauren, and myself. A picture is shown above.
    <br> The project was very fun, but challenging.
    <br> We made a Minion dating simulator,
    <br> where you get to chose different outfits and locations to go on a date.
    <br> It used music, many different sprites, and 5 backgrounds.

<h2 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">6th Project 3.1.6</h2>
  <img src="3.1.6.PNG" height="300">
  <h3 style="font-family: Trebuchet MS">Where Is The Rover?
    <br> This project was completed with Kosu, Taeuk, Amir, and myself.
    <br> The project was extremely challenging and forced us to think very critically.
    <br> We use the sheets of data sent by the rover,
    <br> and decided that we believe the rover stood in the tropical islands.
    <br> The temperature was pretty stable until the daytime when it improved dramatically.
